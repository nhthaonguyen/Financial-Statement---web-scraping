# Financial-Statement-web-scraping
Advantages when using a Python script to import a company's financial statement to Excel:
1. Quickly import financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flow, accounting report, etc) of multiple companies.
2. The Excel file output will be user friendly for further financial statement analysis (such as for forecasting purpose)
3. Simply re-import the data again incase of messing up. 

Python library that I used: 
BeautifulSoup
Pandas

Disclaimer: 
- There is some dynamic sources that can not apply web scraping technique (which I already tried) such as yahoo finance.
- Each financial web page has different HTML tree that should be considered when coding.
